# Autonomous-Plane
After a mountain rescue I experiences where I got lost from my hiking group, and eventually ran out of food and water, I thought having an autonomous plane that could locate lost hikers and deliver resources like food, and water, while communicating their location to rescue services.

The resulting project is a culmination of 3 categories of work:
1. Developing and researching an object detection model and program optimized for human detection in search and rescue missions. This is the link to the research paper I'm writing about this: https://salahudeen.short.gy/evPQSI.
2. Creating the body of the plane from an online tutorial
3. Designing the hardware and logical framework
